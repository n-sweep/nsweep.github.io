    "title": "Has Hasbro Ruined Magic: the Gathering?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Greed - Illustrated by Izzy\n\n\n\nBank of America says Hasbro could fall 34% due to company runing ‘Magic: the Gathering’ card game\n\nI played Magic for a long time, so this article really caught my eye. It’s behind a paywall, though, so if you don’t have CNBC Pro, check out this second article at Magic-specific publication Star City Games:\n\nHasbro Shares Plunge After Bank Of America Report Downgrades Company’s Rating\n\nThis story made me think over what I remembered about collecting and playing Magic in the 90s and 00s, and while doing some research to make sure I was actually remembering things correctly, I wrote down a lot more than I expected.\n\n\nHasbro, Wizards of the Coast, & Magic: the Gathering\nHasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September of 1999. A CNN Money article on the deal told readers “The agreement gives Hasbro, one of the biggest producers of toys and games, exclusive domain over Wizards’ best-known products …”, explicitly calling out “the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game” (of course) and “particularly its Pokemon trading card game – a wildly popular game among children”. No mention of lesser-known “Magic: the Gathering” (which wasn’t based on a popular tv show, hmm..)[1], but that’s no surprise because it’s the turn of the millennium and Pokemon is positively exploding. Fast forward to October, 2022: Magic: the Gathering is Hasbro’s first BILLION dollar brand. In the face of the Pokemon behemoth of the late 90s, who could have said it would be Magic to break that ribbon? Well, some people at Hasbro, probably. But someone else too: me. Not because I knew (or know) anything, but because I loved (love) that damn game.\nIt’s September of 99, Magic is 6, Pokemon is nearly 3, and I am 11. And despite being smack in the bull’s eye of Pokemon’s target demographic, I’m already an avid Magic player, thanks in no small part to my older cousin who found and played the game long before I was old enough to (I have fond memories of looking at the wonderful artwork on his cards years before rediscovering the game in middle school). Hasbro made the purchase and I was too young to really get it, but some of the older guys at the local card shop where I sourced my habit lamented the end of an era. I got it a few years later, when they decided to update the style of the frame, or border surrounding the text and artwork of the card. I got it again years later when “double-faced” cards were introduced, which could transform (or flip) to a different card printed on the back. This one was an atrocity, the back of a Magic card is beautiful and sacred.[2] At this point I had been playing competitively for more than a decade, and not long after made the decision to spend my time and money on music instead of Magic (those cards had appreciated a bit and sure bought a lot of recording equipment).\nBut let’s be real, all that stuff is pretty much superficial. Fans care about it, I cared about it, but the brand didn’t only survive, it thrived. Certainly none of these things were the “end-of-an-era” of a caliber that warranted CNBC articles about the BoA downgrading the company’s rating. Right? Maybe:\n\nHasbro buys WotC in 1999, to the lament of some Magic players\nHasbro changes Magic cards in 2003, much to the lament of many more Magic players\n!!! from Wikipedia: “In June 2003, Nintendo transferred the publishing rights from Wizards of the Coast to The Pokémon Company”\nHasbro changes magic cards again in 2004, very much to the further lament of even more Magic players\n\nNintendo bailed when things were chaotic, perhaps it was a sign of the beginning of a slow decline? Well, we’d have to ignore the fact the Magic continued to be wildly successful for 16 more years before the next cherry-picked part of my story, but perhaps.\nDespite being years away from the game, I got it once again in 2020 when WotC announced a “The Walking Dead” crossover set, the first in what would eventually become the “Universes Beyond” sub-brand of Magic, whatever a “sub-brand” is. The game still holds a place in my heart and this decision made me feel some feelings, but I didn’t play any more so I tried not to have too many opinions. And there was also a pandemic going on I think. Anyway, WotC went on to release 10 more Universes Beyond sets between then and today, with four more on the way; these include such theme-conforming properties as Fortnite, Transformers, and Dr. Who. Grim, indeed.\nSo was the Walking Dead crossover set the real beginning of the end for Hasbro’s golden boy? If we define “end” to mean a CNBC article about the BoA downgrading the company’s rating, then yes, I think so.\nBut even given all the uncertainty around the future of Magic, we can all be sure of one thing: I sure miss playing that stupid game. And that stupid game is worth a billion dollars lol. That’s two things.\n\n[1] An astute reader has pointed out that, while not based on a tv show, Magic tournaments were indeed featured on ESPN2 - there is even footage on YouTube (warning: kind of loud).\n[2] This is an opinion, but not really.\n\n\n\n\nThis page lovingly generated by Quarto ❤️"

    "text": "Build and Preview Your Site\nA nice feature of Jekyll is that it can serve your site locally, so you can check that you’re happy with your edits before pushing them up to your repo. So now that we’re in the shell inside our container, we’ll use Jekyll to create a new site, then serve it and take a look in the browser.\n# Instantiate new site\njekyll new .\n\n# Serve the site locally\njekyll serve\nThis may take some time as well.\n\nGreat, now we can visit http://localhost:4000 and see that we have the basic Jekyll theme applied to our page on our own machine before pushing the repo back to GitHub. Neat! 📷"

These values can be changed in the _config.yml file, which was generated when we called jekyll new . earlier. Different themes can have different configurations, but the basics are pretty self explanitory. Here’s an exceprt from the auto-generated config file:\n# Excerpt from default _config.yaml\n# ...\n\ntitle: Your awesome title\nemail: your-email@example.com\ndescription: &gt;- # this means to ignore newlines until \"baseurl:\"\n  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this\n  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for\n  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.\nbaseurl: \"\" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog\nurl: \"\" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com\ntwitter_username: jekyllrb\ngithub_username:  jekyll\n\n# Build settings\nmarkdown: kramdown\ntheme: minima\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-feed\n\n# ...\n\nWhat to change:\n\nChange the title, the description, and your email\n\nexpress yourself, be compelling and mesmerizing, a tour de force\n\nChange url and maybe baseurl\n\nurl is the url of your site: https://username.github.io\nif your site files are in a subdirectory inside of your repo, baseurl should be equal to the path to your files, otherwise leave blank\n\nIf you choose a custom theme, you may need to change theme\n\nsome themes come with their own _config.yml files\n\nChange custom variables\n\ndifferent themes have different settings\nthe default theme has twitter_username and github_username\ncheck your theme’s GitHub/documentation for instructions"

    "text": "Find A Custom Theme!\nThat’s better but you’ve gotta admit, the default theme is still pretty boring. So now it’s time to choose your own!\nThere are a lot to choose from, and the Jekyll documenatation has a good list of resources for themes. I ended up at jekyllthemes.org and found Monophase. Not much more exciting than the Jekyll default we just saw, but I was going for minimal.\nMaybe Neumorphism is more your style?\nOr Windows 95?\n\n\nInstallation\n\nNote: It probably goes without saying, but always be aware of the licensing associated with others’ code you plan to download and use. Most free Jekyll themes only require attribution and already have it built into the footer of the theme.\n\n\nIt also absolutely goes without saying, but remember McGruff the Crime Dog says “always be mindful of any code you download from anywhere”. This is (obviously) not a security blog!\n\nIf you navigate to their GitHub repos, many of the themes at the links above have their own instructions for installation but for themes that don’t, it’s as easy as forking and pulling the repo and tweaking as needed.\n# First, fork the repo (see the link above)\n# Then clone locally\ngit clone https://github.com/username/windows-95\nThemes will have pages such as index, about, archive, etc… that can be edited to your liking.\nWe’ll leave further tweaking of style and layout as an exercise to the reader (because, to be honest, it’s an exercise for me also). Your theme of choice’s GitHub is usually a good place to start. There’s also google."
