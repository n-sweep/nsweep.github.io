Now I'm back to do it all again! Only this time, with the awesome open-source scientific and technical publishing system [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).\n\n<img src=\"./images/quarto.png\"/>\n\n\n\nIf you want to follow along, you'll need to ensure some prerequisite packages are installed. It's a shorter list than last time:\n\n- [install git](https://git-scm.com/)\n- [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n\n> Note: Package installation is left as an exercise for the reader, as I am on a [non-standard operating system](https://nixos.org)\n\n\n# Hosting with Github Pages\n\nThere are [a number of ways](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) to publish a Quarto website; we'll be using GitHub Pages. There are also a few different ways to publish to Pages; we'll be using the Quarto [publish command](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command).\n\n## Create a New GitHub Repository\n\n**Important:** Your repo should be named with your github username in the format `username.github.io` for GitHub to host it correctly.\n\n[Click here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for a guide on creating a new GitHub repo.\n\n## Clone the Repo Locally\n\nNext we'll move to the directory where we want to store the site's files and clone the repo to our local machine:\n\n```sh\n# this will create a new directory at `/my/target/directory/username.github.io`\n\ncd /my/target/directory\ngit clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git\n```\n\n## Prepare the Repo\n\nAccording to the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command), the repo requires a branch called `gh-pages`, which the `quarto publish` command will write the site to automatically.\n\n### Create the Source Branch\n\n```sh\ngit checkout --orphan gh-pages\ngit reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"Initializing gh-pages branch\"\ngit push origin gh-pages\n```\n\n**Note** - from [the documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#source-branch):\n\n> Double-check that the last git push action has indeed set the Settings : Pages for your repository as expected in the previous figure. [...]\n\nThe screenshot from the docs is a little out of date as of my writing this. They are asking us to ensure our branch is set to \"gh-pages\" and our directory is set to \"root\" like below. (It seems that this *should* happen automatically during one of the previous steps, but best to check if the guide recommends it.)\n\n<img src='./images/gh-pages.png' width=800 />\n\n### `.gitignore`\n\nQuarto is going to generate some files that we don't want to check into version control. Let's add the following to lines to our repo's [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file:\n\n```sh\n/.quarto/\n/_site/\n```\n\n# Quarto\n\nPublishing is going to be a snap with all that GitHub setup out of the way. But now we need something to publish, and Quarto can help with that too.\n\n## Create and View a Template Website\n\n### `quarto create project`\n\nQuarto provides a quickstart command with two options (`website` and `blog`) for initializing a website. This command will create a new directory if we provide it a name, but we want to use our new git repository:\n\n```sh\n# we should still be in `/my/target/directory` from the previous steps\ncd username.github.io\n\nquarto create project website .\n# or\nquarto create project blog .\n```\n\nThere may be other differences, but the `blog` option initializes the site with a [listing page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) as the front page while the `website` option does not.\n\n### `quarto preview`\n\nWhile it isn't very personal yet, we now have a skeleton of a website. Let's take a look at it with:\n\n```sh\nquarto preview\n```\n\nI chose the `blog` option, so this command will open a browser tab that looks something like this:\n\n<img src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/myblog.png\" width=800 />\n\n# Personalize\n\nThe previous steps created a number of files in our repo. From [the documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html):\n\n> Here’s a summary of the key files created within the starter blog project:\n>\n> File                  | Description\n> ----                  | -----------\n> `_quarto.yml`         | Quarto project file.\n> `index.qmd`           | Blog home page.\n> `about.qmd`           | Blog about page.\n> `posts/`              | Directory containing posts\n> `posts/_metadata.yml` | Shared options for posts\n> `styles.css`          | Custom CSS for website\n\n`.qmd` files are essentially [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files with some special Quarto sauce. We can edit `index.qmd` and `about.qmd` to change the content of the pages, and even create new `.qmd` files for additional pages. New pages can be linked to [from other documents](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#linking) and [in the navbar](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#config-file). Since I used the `quarto create project blog` command, the list includes a [`posts/` directory](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory), where blog posts like this one (also written in markdown) live.\n\nIf `quarto preview` is still running in your terminal, the page in your browser should reload whenever you make changes. If not, just run `quarto preview` again to have a look:\n\n<img src=\"./images/new_post.png\" width=800 />\n\n# Publish\n\nNow the git and GitHub setup we did earlier pays off. Once we're happy with the changes and our new blog post, we'll run `quarto publish .`\n\n<img src=\"./images/quarto_publish.gif\" width=800 />\n\nAnd that's it! The rest is automated by Quarto, and when it is finished, it will open the live, updated website in a new browser tab for us to admire.\n\n<img src=\"./images/front_page.png\" width=800 />\n\n<br />\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWay back in 2021 I learned how to build a simple static website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), wrote a few articles (including one about [how I did it](../2021-07-05-how-i-made-this-blog/2021-07-05-how-i-made-this-blog.md)), and then promptly forgot about the project amidst the noise of distractions such as my day job.
