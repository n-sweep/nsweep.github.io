It was after a long day at work, my hands were feeling fatigued, and I thought to myself\n\n> [I work from home, therefore] *I already have a microphone in front of my face, and [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)s exist. I bet [STT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) to the clipboard would be pretty easy...*\n\nIf I've ever heard famous last words, those are them, but it actually did turn out to be relatively easy.\n\n<img src=\"./images/fry_megaphone.gif\" />\n\nThe goal is not just to transcribe audio, but to have a script that will listen to me speak, transcribe the audio to text, and put that text into my system clipboard so I can easily paste it into an email, Slack message, etc..., with a single command.\n\n\nFirst, I wanted to make sure the transcription step was actually as easy as I was assuming. A search for STT APIs brought me to [Deepgram Voice Ai](https://deepgram.com/), who offer a generous $200 credit to a new account. We're good to go there, but we aren't going to hit the API until we have some audio to transcribe...\n\n# Recording My Voice (from the Command Line)\n\nAs I was making the mistake of searching for Python libraries to record audio, it occurred to me that I already knew my system audio was being managed by [Pulse](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) and, for some unrelated reason lost to time, I had recently learned that I could play an audio file with the `pacat` command. There is probably a simple command for recording already available in the terminal. Let's check out the man page for `pacat`:\n\n<img src='./images/pacat.gif' width=600 />\n\nBingo - `pacat` also includes `parecord`, an alias for using the `-r` flag. A quick experiment showed no options were required to record from my default audio device:\n\n```sh\nparecord test.mp3   # record\npacat text.mp3      # playback\n```\n\nThe `parecord` command will run, continuing to record audio, until you interrupt it (with a `Ctrl+C` in this case). The audio is then rendered to the filepath provided (`test.mp3`).\n\nSince API calls can be done with `curl` or `wget`, this means _**we can do the entire workflow in bash!**_\n\n## A Small Problem\n\nListening back to the test file with `pacat`, only the audio which had been fully rendered at the time of the interrupt was retained, leaving off a few seconds at the end of the recording (a few words, unless you pause long enough before interrupting the command).\n\nIdeally, the user should be able to signal to the program that they are done recording at any point after they finish talking. I am not a professional bash developer, and this problem took the majority of this project's time. I ultimately ended up with this, and would love to know if there is a better way (aside from not using bash):\n\n```sh\n# run the recording in a separate process\nparecord 'test.mp3' &\n\n# get the process ID of the previous command\nparec_pid=$!\n\nwhile :  # infinite loop\ndo\n    # read keyboard input\n    read -n 1 key\n\n    # if a q is seen...\n    if [ \"$key\" = \"q\" ]; then\n        # wait 2 seconds for the recording to render\n        sleep 2s\n\n        # kill the recording process\n        kill -SIGINT $parec_pid\n\n        # break the infinite while loop\n        break\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\n## Better File Name Handling\n\nWe need to get rid of the hardcoded `test.mp3` file name and either:\n\n1. Let the user specify the filename OR\n2. Name the file automatically with a smarter naming convention.\n\n```sh\n# make a directory in /tmp/ for holding our recordings\nmkdir -p /tmp/dictation\n\n# if the user has provided an argument (filename)...\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    # replace spaces with underscores and use input as filename\n    filename=$(echo $@ | sed 's/ /_/g')\nelse\n    # otherwise, use a timestamp as the filename\n    # with seconds included to avoid duplicate filenames\n    filename=$(date +%s)\nfi\n\n# set the final file location in our /tmp/dictation directory from earlier\nfile_loc=\"/tmp/dictation/$filename.mp3\"\n```\n\n## The Recording Script\n\nPutting these together gives us a complete recording script (below). I've added some `echo` outputs for the user:\n\n<img src='./images/rec_script.gif' width=600 />\n\n```sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nmkdir -p /tmp/dictation\n\n# check for filename or use timestamp\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    filename=$(echo $@ | sed 's/ /_/g')\nelse\n    filename=$(date +%s)\nfi\n\nfile_loc=\"/tmp/dictation/$filename.mp3\"\n\nparecord $file_loc &\nparec_pid=$!\n\necho \"recording. press q to stop\"\n\n# loop waits for 'q' and stops recording\nwhile :\ndo\n    read -n 1 key\n    if [ \"$key\" = \"q\" ]; then\n        echo && echo \"stopping recording...\"\n        sleep 2s\n        kill -SIGINT $parec_pid\n        break\n    fi\ndone\n\necho \"${file_loc} saved.\"\n```\n\n# Deepgram\n\nWe're saving audio successfully, so now it's time to send it off to the Deepgram API for transcription. The [documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio#curl) has examples for remote files and for local files - we want the local file example:\n\n<img src='./images/dg_docs.gif' width=600 />\n\n## Editing the Request\n\n```sh\ncurl \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \\\n  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \\\n  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&smart_format=true'\n```\n\nWe're going to use the default model and format rules from this example, so the two variables we need to concern ourselves with are the audio we want to transcribe and our Deepgram API key. Our recording script from above is already providing us with the audio file, so we'll get to that later.\n\n### API Key\n\nRather than set my API key as an environment variable, I have saved it at a local location in my home directory, from which the script will read before providing the token to the request.\n\n```sh\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=\"$(head -1 \"$HOME/path/to/my/deepgram/token\")\"\ncurl \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Token ${DEEPGRAM_API_KEY}\" \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \\\n  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \\\n  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&smart_format=true'\n```\n\nSpecifically note the change from the example's single quotes to a set of double quotes when inserting the variable:\n\n<img src='./images/dg_api_key.gif' width=600 />\n\n## This is Only a Test\n\nRunning a test with our test recording from earlier...\n\n```sh\n--data-binary @/tmp/dictation/test.mp3 \\\n```\n\nAnd it works! But it doesn't just return the simple text we're looking for, the response we get back is [JSON](https://www.json.org/).\n\n<img src='./images/what_is_that.gif' width=600 />\n\n## Parsing the Response\n\nLet's add an output flag to the transcription call to save the file so we can work with it without re-calling the API again and again:\n\n```sh\ncurl -o /tmp/dictation/test.json \\\n# ...\n```\n\n### `jq`\n\nNext we'll use [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to make the output more readable:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n

list, so we access it with a pair of square brackets.

For this we'll use [`xclip`]():\n\n    WHAT IS XCLIP?\n    ==============\n    xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system with an\n    X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X selections (\"the clipboard\")\n    from the command line. It can read data from standard in or a file and place it\n    in an X selection for pasting into other X applications. xclip can also print\n    an X selection to standard out, which can then be redirected to a file or\n    another program.\n\nUsage is pretty straightforward; we use the `-i` flag to push text into the clipboard (alternatively, the `-o` flag can be used to read the contents of the clipboard):\n\n\n```sh\necho \"Hi mom!\" | xclip -i -selection clipboard\n```\n\nHere's what it would look like added to our parsing test code:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json \\\n    | jq \".results.channels[].alternatives[].transcript\" \\\n    | sed 's/^\"\\(.*\\)\"$/\\1/'\n    | xclip -i -selection clipboard\n```\n\n# Putting It All Together\n\nThe final script is below, see the `[NOTE]`s for explanation of things not explicitly shown above.

It was after a long day at work, my hands were feeling fatigued, and I thought to myself\n\n> [I work from home, therefore] *I already have a microphone in front of my face, and [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)s exist. I bet [STT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) to the clipboard would be pretty easy...*\n\nIf I've ever heard famous last words, those are them, but it actually did turn out to be relatively easy.\n\n<img src=\"./images/fry_megaphone.gif\" />\n\nThe goal is not just to transcribe audio, but to have a script that will listen to me speak, transcribe the audio to text, and put that text into my system clipboard so I can easily paste it into an email, Slack message, etc..., with a single command.\n\n# Speech-to-Text Transcription\n\nFirst, I wanted to make sure the transcription step was actually as easy as I was assuming. A search for STT APIs brought me to [Deepgram Voice Ai](https://deepgram.com/), who offer a generous $200 credit to a new account. We're good to go there, but we aren't going to hit the API until we have some audio to transcribe...\n\n# Recording My Voice (from the Command Line)\n\nAs I was making the mistake of searching for Python libraries to record audio, it occurred to me that I already knew my system audio was being managed by [Pulse](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) and, for some unrelated reason lost to time, I had recently learned that I could play an audio file with the `pacat` command. There is probably a simple command for recording already available in the terminal. Let's check out the man page for `pacat`:\n\n<img src='./images/pacat.gif' width=600 />\n\nBingo - `pacat` also includes `parecord`, an alias for using the `-r` flag. A quick experiment showed no options were required to record from my default audio device:\n\n```sh\nparecord test.mp3   # record\npacat text.mp3      # playback\n```\n\nThe `parecord` command will run, continuing to record audio, until you interrupt it (with a `Ctrl+C` in this case). The audio is then rendered to the filepath provided (`test.mp3`).\n\nSince API calls can be done with `curl` or `wget`, this means _**we can do the entire workflow in bash!**_\n\n## A Small Problem\n\nListening back to the test file with `pacat`, only the audio which had been fully rendered at the time of the interrupt was retained, leaving off a few seconds at the end of the recording (a few words, unless you pause long enough before interrupting the command).\n\nIdeally, the user should be able to signal to the program that they are done recording at any point after they finish talking. I am not a professional bash developer, and this problem took the majority of this project's time. I ultimately ended up with this, and would love to know if there is a better way (aside from not using bash):\n\n```sh\n# run the recording in a separate process\nparecord 'test.mp3' &\n\n# get the process ID of the previous command\nparec_pid=$!\n\nwhile :  # infinite loop\ndo\n    # read keyboard input\n    read -n 1 key\n\n    # if a q is seen...\n    if [ \"$key\" = \"q\" ]; then\n        # wait 2 seconds for the recording to render\n        sleep 2s\n\n        # kill the recording process\n        kill -SIGINT $parec_pid\n\n        # break the infinite while loop\n        break\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\n## Better File Name Handling\n\nWe need to get rid of the hardcoded `test.mp3` file name and either:\n\n1. Let the user specify the filename OR\n2. Name the file automatically with a smarter naming convention.\n\n```sh\n# make a directory in /tmp/ for holding our recordings\nmkdir -p /tmp/dictation\n\n# if the user has provided an argument (filename)...\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    # replace spaces with underscores and use input as filename\n    filename=$(echo $@ | sed 's/ /_/g')\nelse\n    # otherwise, use a timestamp as the filename\n    # with seconds included to avoid duplicate filenames\n    filename=$(date +%s)\nfi\n\n# set the final file location in our /tmp/dictation directory from earlier\nfile_loc=\"/tmp/dictation/$filename.mp3\"\n```\n\n## The Recording Script\n\nPutting these together gives us a complete recording script (below). I've added some `echo` outputs for the user:\n\n<img src='./images/rec_script.gif' width=600 />\n\n```sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nmkdir -p /tmp/dictation\n\n# check for filename or use timestamp\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    filename=$(echo $@ | sed 's/ /_/g')\nelse\n    filename=$(date +%s)\nfi\n\nfile_loc=\"/tmp/dictation/$filename.mp3\"\n\nparecord $file_loc &\nparec_pid=$!\n\necho \"recording. press q to stop\"\n\n# loop waits for 'q' and stops recording\nwhile :\ndo\n    read -n 1 key\n    if [ \"$key\" = \"q\" ]; then\n        echo && echo \"stopping recording...\"\n        sleep 2s\n        kill -SIGINT $parec_pid\n        break\n    fi\ndone\n\necho \"${file_loc} saved.\"\n```\n\n# Deepgram\n\nWe're saving audio successfully, so now it's time to send it off to the Deepgram API for transcription. The [documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio#curl) has examples for remote files and for local files - we want the local file example:\n\n<img src='./images/dg_docs.gif' width=600 />\n\n## Editing the Request\n\n```sh\ncurl \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \\\n  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \\\n  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&smart_format=true'\n```\n\nWe're going to use the default model and format rules from this example, so the two variables we need to concern ourselves with are the audio we want to transcribe and our Deepgram API key. Our recording script from above is already providing us with the audio file, so we'll get to that later.\n\n### API Key\n\nRather than set my API key as an environment variable, I have saved it at a local location in my home directory, from which the script will read before providing the token to the request.\n\n```sh\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=\"$(head -1 \"$HOME/path/to/my/deepgram/token\")\"\ncurl \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Token ${DEEPGRAM_API_KEY}\" \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \\\n  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \\\n  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&smart_format=true'\n```\n\nSpecifically note the change from the example's single quotes to a set of double quotes when inserting the variable:\n\n<img src='./images/dg_api_key.gif' width=600 />\n\n## This is Only a Test\n\nRunning a test with our test recording from earlier...\n\n```sh\n--data-binary @/tmp/dictation/test.mp3 \\\n```\n\nAnd it works! But it doesn't just return the simple text we're looking for, the response we get back is [JSON](https://www.json.org/).\n\n<img src='./images/what_is_that.gif' width=600 />\n\n## Parsing the Response\n\nLet's add an output flag to the transcription call to save the file so we can work with it without re-calling the API again and again:\n\n```sh\ncurl -o /tmp/dictation/test.json \\\n# ...\n```\n\n### `jq`\n\nNext we'll use [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to make the output more readable:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n

 }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMuch better!\n\nThis data is small enough for us to read and determine that our target is in `results > channels > alternatives > transcript` but if your data is too unwieldy to scroll through, we can use `jq` to get the keys of the outermost mapping:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq \"keys\"\n```\n\n```json\n[\n  \"metadata\",\n  \"results\"\n]\n```\n\nThen we can use those keys to index the nested structure:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq \".results\"\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": {\n    \"channels\": [\n

list, so we access it with a pair of square brackets. The same is true for its child `alternatives`:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq \".results.channels[].alternatives[]\"\n```\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"transcript\": \"Check 123.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.90280044,\n    \"words\": [\n      {\n        \"word\": \"check\",\n        \"start\": 0.96,\n        \"end\": 1.46,\n        \"confidence\": 0.90280044,\n        \"punctuated_word\": \"Check\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"word\": \"123\",\n        \"start\": 1.68,\n        \"end\": 2.1799998,\n        \"confidence\": 0.88839245,\n        \"punctuated_word\": \"123.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"paragraphs\": {\n      \"transcript\": \"\\nCheck 123.\",\n      \"paragraphs\": [\n        {\n          \"sentences\": [\n            {\n              \"text\": \"Check 123.\",\n              \"start\": 0.96,\n              \"end\": 2.1799998\n            }\n          ],\n          \"num_words\": 2,\n          \"start\": 0.96,\n          \"end\": 2.1799998\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq \".results.channels[].alternatives[] | keys\"\n```\n\n```json\n[\n  \"confidence\",\n  \"paragraphs\",\n  \"transcript\",\n  \"words\"\n]\n```\n\nAn item in `alternatives` contains the full `transcript` that we are looking for, a confidence score (from 0 to 1), and a by-paragraph and by-word breakdown. Let's get the transcript:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json | jq \".results.channels[].alternatives[].transcript\"\n```\n\n```sh\n\"Check 123.\"\n```\n\n### \"Removing the Quotes\"\n\nThe output from `jq` includes a set of quotes that we don't want in our final product; we can remove them with [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html), which can use pattern matching for text replacement:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json \\\n    | jq \".results.channels[].alternatives[].transcript\" \\\n    | sed 's/^\"\\(.*\\)\"$/\\1/'\n```\n\n```sh\nCheck 123.\n```\n\nLooking good!\n\n# Copying the Transcription to the Clipboard\n\nThe bow on top of this project is copying the resulting transcription to the clipboard for easy pasting into your AIM conversation or MySpace post. For this we'll use [`xclip`]():\n\n    WHAT IS XCLIP?\n    ==============\n    xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system with an\n    X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X selections (\"the clipboard\")\n    from the command line. It can read data from standard in or a file and place it\n    in an X selection for pasting into other X applications. xclip can also print\n    an X selection to standard out, which can then be redirected to a file or\n    another program.\n\nUsage is pretty straightforward; we use the `-i` flag to push text into the clipboard (alternatively, the `-o` flag can be used to read the contents of the clipboard):\n\n\n```sh\necho \"Hi mom!\" | xclip -i -selection clipboard\n```\n\nHere's what it would look like added to our parsing test code:\n\n```sh\ncat /tmp/dictation/test.json \\\n    | jq \".results.channels[].alternatives[].transcript\" \\\n    | sed 's/^\"\\(.*\\)\"$/\\1/'\n    | xclip -i -selection clipboard\n```\n\n# Putting It All Together\n\nThe final script is below, see the `[NOTE]`s for explanation of things not explicitly shown above. Here it is in action:\n\n<img src='./images/dg_only_a_test.gif' width=600 />\n\n```sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=\"$(head -1 \"$HOME/path/to/my/deepgram/token\")\"\n\nmkdir -p
