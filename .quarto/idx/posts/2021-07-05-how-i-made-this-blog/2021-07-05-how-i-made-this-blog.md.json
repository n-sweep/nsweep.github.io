It seemed really complex and, as a hobbyist programmer, unnecessary. Turns out it isn't either of those things and also, it rules. Ever since I started studying data science, I use it regularly and I really enjoy the benefits of containerization.\n\nRecently I learned how to use a `Dockerfile` to build custom Docker images and, after building an image based on Alpine Linux to run neovim and zsh for a consistent, portable text editor and python environment (I'll write about that soon), I wanted to document the process for my future self. Coincidentally, I had also recently read how easy it was to host a website with GitHubPages and only needed an excuse to learn how. It's all coming together.\n\nWe're going to go through the process of hosting a blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), making posts, and building its structure and theme using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (whatever that is) with a little help from - you guessed it - Docker.\n\n\n# Hosting with Github Pages\n\n> Note: I completed these steps on a `Pop!_OS 21.04` machine.\n\n## First, Some Prerequisites\nWe will need Git and Docker installed. Later, we're going to use Docker to pull down a Jekyll image so we don't have to install Jekyll and all its dependencies. If you have trouble with these commands, check these installation links for [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) & [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).\n\n``` bash\n# Update\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# Install Git\nsudo apt-get install git-all\n\n# Install Docker\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n```\n\n## [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) A New GitHub Repository\nIf you don't know how, just visit the link above. Your repo should be named with your github username in the format `username.github.io` for GitHub to host it correctly.\n\n## Clone the Repo and Add Some Content!\nNext, move to the directory where you would like to store your site's files and clone the repo to your local machine. Navigate into the repo directory and create an index markdown file, which will serve as your site's home page, and finally push your changes back up to GitHub:\n\n``` bash\n# Clone Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git\n\n# Navigate into project folder\ncd username.github.io\n\n# Create index.md and add some C O N T E N T\necho \"C O N T E N T\" > index.md\n\n# Push changes\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"initial commit\"\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n<br />\n\n## And You're finished!\nWell done. Grab a cold beverage, pat yourself on the back, and visit **https://_username_.github.io** in a browser to view your handiwork.\n \n<img src=\"./images/content.jpg\" width=800 />\n\n### ... Looks Kinda Boring Though, Doesn't It?\nSure does. Why don't we take GitHub's [advice](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) and use Jekyll, whatever that is.\n\n\n# Adding Some Spice with a Jekyll Theme\n\nFrom the GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll):\n\n> Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages and a simplified build process. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts...\n\nI'm not familiar with Jekyll in the slightest, but I am familiar with Docker, and a quick trip to Docker Hub yields an official [Jekyll Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll)! Now we can pull down the image and use Jekyll without installing it locally. Radical.\n\n## Pull Down the Jekyll Docker Image\n\nIf you try to call `docker run` on an image you don't have locally, Docker will attempt to retrieve the image from Docker Hub if it exists. We'll run the Jekyll version 3.8 image (I had a weird permissions problem with the latest build), pull it down from the hub, and open up a bash shell inside of it.\n\n``` bash\n# You're probably still there but if not, navigate to the repo directory\ncd /path/to/username.github.io\n\n# Pull down and open a shell in the Jekyll image\ndocker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -v ${PWD}:/srv/jekyll jekyll/jekyll:3.8 bash\n```\n\nThis may take a minute.\n\n<img src=\"./images/docker_install.gif\" />\n\nWhile you wait for the Jekyll image to download, let's talk about what this command is doing. \n\nFrom the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/):\n> The `docker run` command first `creates` a writeable container layer over the specified image, and then `starts` it using the specified command.\n\nSimple enough. Here's what the rest of it does:\n\n- `docker run --rm -it`\n    - create a container that will be removed (`--rm`) when we're finished with it and enble an interactive terminal connection (`-it`)*\n- `-p 4000:4000`\n    - publish (or expose) port 4000 on the local machine to the same port inside the container (this is the port Jekyll uses to serve locally)\n    - these ports do not have to match, eg. `-p 9999:80` could be a valid mapping\n    - local port is always first: `local_port:container_port`\n- `-v ${PWD}:/srv/jekyll`\n    - mount the directory we're currently in (`${PWD}`) to the directory that Jekyll uses to build the site inside the container (`/srv/jekyll`)\n    - again, local is always first: `local_dir:container_dir`\n- `jekyll/jekyll:3.8 bash`\n    - specify that we want the official `jekyll/jekyll` image, version `3.8`\n    - start the container and open an interactive `bash` shell\n\nYou can find more information about the `docker run` flags in the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)  \n\\* You can find a great explaination of the `-it` flags at this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40026942/11737314)\n\n<br />\n\n> ### **Important Note!**\n\n> In a moment, we will use Jekyll to build the structure and theme for our site.  \n> By mapping our site's local git repository to `/srv/jekyll` in the container, we allow Jekyll to save all the site files it generates locally in our repo. *These files are all GitHub needs to build our site* at **https://_username_.github.io**.  \n> This allows us to ditch our Docker container (and even the image) when we're finished, freeing up the space taken up by Jekyll and its dependencies and leaving behind the site files for us to push to GitHub for hosting.\n\n\n## Build and Preview Your Site\n\nA nice feature of Jekyll is that it can serve your site locally, so you can check that you're happy with your edits before pushing them up to your repo. So now that we're in the shell inside our container, we'll use Jekyll to create a new site, then serve it and take a look in the browser.\n\n``` bash\n# Instantiate new site\njekyll new .\n\n# Serve the site locally\njekyll serve\n```\n\nThis may take some time as well.\n\n<img src=\"./images/jekyll_new_serve.gif\" />\n\nGreat, now we can visit **http://localhost:4000** and see that we have the basic Jekyll theme applied to our page on our own machine before pushing the repo back to GitHub. Neat! 📷\n\n<img src=\"./images/jekyll_basic.jpg\" width=800 />\n\n## Editing Fields\n\nYou'll probably notice that your website is populated with filler text like `Your Awesome Title` and `your-email@example.com`. These values can be changed in the `_config.yml` file, which was generated when we called `jekyll new .` earlier. Different themes can have different configurations, but the basics are pretty self explanitory. Here's an exceprt from the auto-generated config file:\n\n``` yaml\n# Excerpt from default _config.yaml\n# ...\n\ntitle: Your awesome title\nemail: your-email@example.com\ndescription: >- # this means to ignore newlines until \"baseurl:\"\n  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this\n  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for\n  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.\nbaseurl: \"\" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog\nurl: \"\" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com\ntwitter_username: jekyllrb\ngithub_username:  jekyll\n\n# Build settings\nmarkdown: kramdown\ntheme: minima\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-feed\n\n# ...\n```\n### What to change:\n- Change the `title`, the `description`, and your `email`\n    - express yourself, be compelling and mesmerizing, a tour de force\n- Change `url` and maybe `baseurl`\n    - `url` is the url of your site: `https://username.github.io`\n    - if your site files are in a subdirectory inside of your repo, `baseurl` should be equal to the path to your files, otherwise leave blank\n- If you choose a custom theme, you may need to change `theme`\n    - some themes come with their own `_config.yml` files\n- Change custom variables\n    - different themes have different settings\n    - the default theme has `twitter_username` and `github_username`\n    - check your theme's GitHub/documentation for instructions\n\n## Find A Custom Theme!\n\nThat's better but you've gotta admit, the default theme is still pretty boring. So now it's time to choose your own!\n\nThere are a lot to choose from, and the Jekyll documenatation has a [good list](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) of resources for themes. I ended up at [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/) and found [Monophase](https://zivlog.io/monophase/). Not much more exciting than the Jekyll default we just saw, but I was going for minimal.  \n\nMaybe [Neumorphism](https://longpdo.github.io/neumorphism/) is more your style?  \n\nOr [Windows 95](https://h01000110.github.io/windows-95/)?\n\n<img src=\"./images/windows95.jpg\" />\n\n### Installation\n\n> Note: It probably goes without saying, but always be aware of the licensing associated with others' code you plan to download and use. Most free Jekyll themes only require attribution and already have it built into the footer of the theme.\n\n> It also absolutely goes without saying, but remember McGruff the Crime Dog says \"always be mindful of any code you download from anywhere\". This is (obviously) not a security blog!\n\nIf you navigate to their GitHub repos, many of the themes at the links above have their own instructions for installation but for themes that don't, it's as easy as [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and pulling the repo and tweaking as needed.\n\n``` bash\n# First, fork the repo (see the link above)\n# Then clone locally\ngit clone https://github.com/username/windows-95\n```\nThemes will have pages such as `index`, `about`, `archive`, etc... that can be edited to your liking.\n\nWe'll leave further tweaking of style and layout as an exercise to the reader (because, to be honest, it's an exercise for me also). Your theme of choice's GitHub is usually a good place to start. There's also [google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=customize+jekyll+theme).\n\n# Make A Post!\n\nThe time has come. This is what you've been training for. Unless of course you've chosen a different theme layout such as a landing page, CV, or gallery and this section is irrelevant to you.\n\nAnyway, after completing the previous steps we should have a `_posts/` directory in our repo and, as luck would have it, we're gonna keep our posts in there. Even if you haven't downloaded a custom theme, the standard Jekyll theme created when we called `jekyll new .` should include a sample post in this directory. The sample includes includes instructions on creating your own posts. Make a copy and use it as a template!\n\nAs you edit your new post, use your locally hosted site at **http://localhost:4000** to check your work.\n\nOnce you've finished your post, push it back up to GitHub. This should look familiar from way back when we hosted our very first iteration:\n\n``` bash\n# Push changes\ngit add --all   # See note above\ngit commit -m \"publishing a post!\"\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n> Note: as your repo gets more complex, you don't always want to `git add --all`. Read [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) about using `.gitignore` or `git add` files individually.\n\n## Done for Real!\n\nFinally, head back over to **https://_username_.github.io**, and[ ](https://n-sweep.github.io/alts/how-i-made-this-blog/#done-for-real)would you look at that! Your opinion on the internet! Out*standing!*\n\n# Epilogue: Removing the Docker Image\n\nNow that you've hosted and edited your site, chosen your theme, created a blog post and pushed it all back up to GitHub, you may want to remove the Jekyll Docker image from your machine. You can always pull it back down and use it again as needed with the `docker run` command we used to create our container initially.\n\n## If your Jekyll server is still running:\n\nPress `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the server and type `exit` to close the Docker container.\n\n``` bash\n# ...\n# Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/srv/jekyll'\n#     Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/\n#   Server running... press ctrl-c to stop\n<Ctrl + C>\n\n# Type 'exit' to close the docker container\nexit\n```\n\n## Remove the Docker Image:\nLook at your Docker images and remove the Jekyll image.\n``` bash\n# List your docker images\ndocker images\n\n# REPOSITORY                    TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE\n# alpine                        3          d4ff818577bc   3 weeks ago     5.6MB\n# ubuntu                        latest     26b77e58432b   3 months ago    72.9MB\n# jupyter/tensorflow-notebook   latest     804645d9e7e7   4 months ago    3.75GB\n# jupyter/pyspark-notebook      latest     3eba429b2f1f   4 months ago    3.55GB\n# mongo                         latest     ca8e14b1fda6   5 months ago    493MB\n# jekyll/jekyll                 3.8        f68afd75b4c4   22 months ago   457MB\n\n# Remove the image\n# REPOSITORY:   jekyll/jekyll\n# TAG:          3.8\n# ID:           f68afd75b4c4\n\n# Either are valid:\n# docker image rm f68afd75b4c4\ndocker image rm jekyll/jekyll:3.8\n```\n\nAnd congratulations, you've done it!\n\n\n<br />\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### Contents:\n\n- [Get Hosted](#hosting-with-github-pages)\n- [Add A Jekyll Theme](#adding-some-spice-with-a-jekyll-theme)\n    - [Pull Jekyll Docker Image](#pull-down-the-jekyll-docker-image)\n    - [Build Site with Default Theme](#build-your-jekyll-site-and-check-out-the-new-template)\n    - [Edit Site Fields](#editing-fields)\n    - [Custom Themes](#find-a-custom-theme)\n- [Make A Post!](#make-a-post)\n- [Remove the Docker Image](#epilogue-removing-the-docker-image)\n\n### I Think Docker is Rad 🐳\n\nI was always hesitant to learn Docker.

The sample includes includes instructions on creating your own posts. Make a copy and use it as a template!\n\nAs you edit your new post, use your locally hosted site at **http://localhost:4000** to check your work.\n\nOnce you've finished your post, push it back up to GitHub. This should look familiar from way back when we hosted our very first iteration:\n\n``` bash\n# Push changes\ngit add --all   # See note above\ngit commit -m \"publishing a post!\"\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n> Note: as your repo gets more complex, you don't always want to `git add --all`. Read [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) about using `.gitignore` or `git add` files individually.\n\n## Done for Real!\n\nFinally, head back over to **https://_username_.github.io**, and[ ](https://n-sweep.github.io/alts/how-i-made-this-blog/#done-for-real)would you look at that! Your opinion on the internet! Out*standing!*\n\n# Epilogue: Removing the Docker Image\n\nNow that you've hosted and edited your site, chosen your theme, created a blog post and pushed it all back up to GitHub, you may want to remove the Jekyll Docker image from your machine. You can always pull it back down and use it again as needed with the `docker run` command we used to create our container initially.\n\n## If your Jekyll server is still running:\n\nPress `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the server and type `exit` to close the Docker container.\n\n``` bash\n# ...\n# Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/srv/jekyll'\n#     Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/\n#   Server running... press ctrl-c to stop\n<Ctrl + C>\n\n# Type 'exit' to close the docker container\nexit\n```\n\n## Remove the Docker Image:\nLook at your Docker images and remove the Jekyll image.\n``` bash\n# List your docker images\ndocker images\n\n# REPOSITORY                    TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE\n# alpine                        3          d4ff818577bc
