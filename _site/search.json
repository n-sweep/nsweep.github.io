    "title": "Has Hasbro Ruined Magic: the Gathering?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Greed - Illustrated by Izzy\n\n\n\nBank of America says Hasbro could fall 34% due to company ruining ‘Magic: the Gathering’ card game\n\nI played Magic for a long time, so this article really caught my eye. It’s behind a paywall, though, so if you don’t have CNBC Pro, check out this second article at Magic-specific publication Star City Games:\n\nHasbro Shares Plunge After Bank Of America Report Downgrades Company’s Rating\n\nThis story made me think over what I remembered about collecting and playing Magic in the 90s and 00s, and while doing some research to make sure I was actually remembering things correctly, I wrote down a lot more than I expected.\n\n\nHasbro, Wizards of the Coast, & Magic: the Gathering\nHasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September of 1999. A CNN Money article on the deal told readers “The agreement gives Hasbro, one of the biggest producers of toys and games, exclusive domain over Wizards’ best-known products …”, explicitly calling out “the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game” (of course) and “particularly its Pokemon trading card game – a wildly popular game among children”. No mention of lesser-known “Magic: the Gathering” (which wasn’t based on a popular tv show, hmm..)[1], but that’s no surprise because it’s the turn of the millennium and Pokemon is positively exploding. Fast forward to October, 2022: Magic: the Gathering is Hasbro’s first BILLION dollar brand. In the face of the Pokemon behemoth of the late 90s, who could have said it would be Magic to break that ribbon? Well, some people at Hasbro, probably. But someone else too: me. Not because I knew (or know) anything, but because I loved (love) that damn game.\nIt’s September of 99, Magic is 6, Pokemon is nearly 3, and I am 11. And despite being smack in the bull’s eye of Pokemon’s target demographic, I’m already an avid Magic player, thanks in no small part to my older cousin who found and played the game long before I was old enough to (I have fond memories of looking at the wonderful artwork on his cards years before rediscovering the game in middle school). Hasbro made the purchase and I was too young to really get it, but some of the older guys at the local card shop where I sourced my habit lamented the end of an era. I got it a few years later, when they decided to update the style of the frame, or border surrounding the text and artwork of the card. I got it again years later when “double-faced” cards were introduced, which could transform (or flip) to a different card printed on the back. This one was an atrocity, the back of a Magic card is beautiful and sacred.[2] At this point I had been playing competitively for more than a decade, and not long after made the decision to spend my time and money on music instead of Magic (those cards had appreciated a bit and sure bought a lot of recording equipment).\nBut let’s be real, all that stuff is pretty much superficial. Fans care about it, I cared about it, but the brand didn’t only survive, it thrived. Certainly none of these things were the “end-of-an-era” of a caliber that warranted CNBC articles about the BoA downgrading the company’s rating. Right? Maybe:\n\nHasbro buys WotC in 1999, to the lament of some Magic players\nHasbro changes Magic cards in 2003, much to the lament of many more Magic players\n!!! from Wikipedia: “In June 2003, Nintendo transferred the publishing rights from Wizards of the Coast to The Pokémon Company”\nHasbro changes magic cards again in 2004, very much to the further lament of even more Magic players\n\nNintendo bailed when things were chaotic, perhaps it was a sign of the beginning of a slow decline? Well, we’d have to ignore the fact the Magic continued to be wildly successful for 16 more years before the next cherry-picked part of my story, but perhaps.\nDespite being years away from the game, I got it once again in 2020 when WotC announced a “The Walking Dead” crossover set, the first in what would eventually become the “Universes Beyond” sub-brand of Magic, whatever a “sub-brand” is. The game still holds a place in my heart and this decision made me feel some feelings, but I didn’t play any more so I tried not to have too many opinions. And there was also a pandemic going on I think. Anyway, WotC went on to release 10 more Universes Beyond sets between then and today, with four more on the way; these include such theme-conforming properties as Fortnite, Transformers, and Dr. Who. Grim, indeed.\nSo was the Walking Dead crossover set the real beginning of the end for Hasbro’s golden boy? If we define “end” to mean a CNBC article about the BoA downgrading the company’s rating, then yes, I think so.\nBut even given all the uncertainty around the future of Magic, we can all be sure of one thing: I sure miss playing that stupid game. And that stupid game is worth a billion dollars lol. That’s two things.\n\n[1] An astute reader has pointed out that, while not based on a tv show, Magic tournaments were indeed featured on ESPN2 - there is even footage on YouTube (warning: kind of loud).\n[2] This is an opinion, but not really.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page lovingly generated by Quarto ❤️"

I and a few friends I have roped into learning with me have been playing on online-go.com (OGS), both via their website and a third party Android app called Sente.

    "text": "Representing the Board\nConsidering that the board is simply a 2d array, numpy is the perfect choice for representing the game’s state. Zeros are empty spaces, ones will be black stones, and twos will be white stones. Let’s start with some constants and a board.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# let's start with a 9x9 board for the sake of brevity\nsize = 9\nstate = np.zeros((size,size), dtype=int)\nstate[4, 4] = 1\nstate[2, 3] = 2\nprint(state)\narray([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nGame Pieces & Intersections\nNow we can loop over the game state to make a friendlier render of the game. Default monospace fonts in browsers are often a bit tall and narrow - if this looks a little awkward, there are screenshots coming up.\nB = \"⚫\"\nW = \"⚪\"\nPT = \"╶╴\"\n\nfor row in state:\n    print(''.join([(PT,B,W)[i] for i in row]))\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴⚪╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴⚫╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n\n\nAdding Star Points to the Board\nStar points have no value or significance in Go, they are simply there to orient ourselves on the board. It just doesn’t look quite right without them though.\nI wrote this in a fever dream. Through liberal use of the walrus operator, we set the location of each star point to a -1. By creating an array the same size as our game board, we’ll be able to combine them.\nTo be more specific, corners calculates the spacing between star points based on the size of the board (13 and 19 size boards have the same spacing), then we use product() to give us every combination of appropriate points on the board, adding in the middle point manually.\nfrom itertools import product\n\nstar_points = np.zeros((size,size), dtype=int)\ncorners = [j for i in range(3) if (j:=((s:=2+(size&gt;9))+(2*s*i))) &lt; size]\npts = [(f:=size//2, f)] + list(product(corners, repeat=2))\nstar_points[*zip(*pts)] = -1\n\nprint(star_points)\nWhy -1? The way things are written so far, a 3 would also work. I wanted the ability to get all stones on the board by filtering the state for any positions that are greater than zero, however I inadvertently skirted this problem by only applying the star points to the board directly before printing and the -1 stuck around.\narray([[ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  0, -1,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  0, -1,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]])\n“Masking” is a useful technique where we create an array of boolean values of the same shape as an array of data. The array of booleans, or ‘mask’, can then be applied to the array of data by indexing: data[mask]. This allows us to return or affect only the values that align with True values in the mask.\nBy masking out the game pieces that have already been played (any points that are not 0), we can assign the star points to the game board only if a piece hasn’t already been played in that position.\nSP = \"╺╸\"\n\n# make a copy before applying the star points; we don't want our game state to\n# contain anything other than zeros, ones, and twos\nboard = state.copy()\nmask = ~state.astype(bool)\nboard[mask] = star_points[mask]\n\nfor row in board:\n    print(''.join([(PT,B,W,SP)[i] for i in row]))\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╺╸⚪╶╴╶╴╺╸╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴⚫╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╺╸╶╴╶╴╶╴╺╸╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴╶╴\n\n\nLabelling the Rows & Columns\nNext up are row and column labels.

The example below is pretty basic, but it works for me. (If you have any trouble, check the documentation.) Just replace network_name with the SSID you’d like the Pi to connect to and replace password with the associated password.\ncountry=us\nupdate_config=1\nctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant\n\nnetwork={\n scan_ssid=1\n ssid=\"network_name\"\n psk=\"password\"\n}\n\nAnd That’s It!\nFinally we can eject our SD card, insert it into the Pi and power it up!

No problem, we can do that with VNC!\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates, over a network.\n\nRaspberry Pi OS comes pre-loaded with RealVNC’s VNC Server, allowing it to be controlled remotely by another computer. To use it, we need to:\n\n- Enable VNC Server on the Raspberry Pi\n\nConnect to your Pi via SSH using the instructions above.\nStart the configuration tool with the command sudo raspi-config. You’ll be met with a screen like this: \nNavigate to Interface Options, then VNC and answer ‘Yes’ when asked to enable VNC.\n\n\n\n- Install VNC Viewer on our Local Machine and Connect!\n\nVisit the VNC Viewer download page and install the appropriate software on your local machine.\nRun the VNC viewer and enter your Pi’s IP address in the bar at the top of the window. (The application will warn us that it doesn’t regonize this server, which is normal since this is the first time we’ve connected to it.)\nFinally, enter your credentials and voilà! You can use the Raspberry Pi’s desktop right in the VNC Viewer window!"

Here’s what the rest of it does:\n\ndocker run --rm -it\n\ncreate a container that will be removed (--rm) when we’re finished with it and enble an interactive terminal connection (-it)*\n\n-p 4000:4000\n\npublish (or expose) port 4000 on the local machine to the same port inside the container (this is the port Jekyll uses to serve locally)\nthese ports do not have to match, eg. -p 9999:80 could be a valid mapping\nlocal port is always first: local_port:container_port\n\n-v ${PWD}:/srv/jekyll\n\nmount the directory we’re currently in (${PWD}) to the directory that Jekyll uses to build the site inside the container (/srv/jekyll)\nagain, local is always first: local_dir:container_dir\n\njekyll/jekyll:3.8 bash\n\nspecify that we want the official jekyll/jekyll image, version 3.8\nstart the container and open an interactive bash shell\n\n\nYou can find more information about the docker run flags in the documentation\n* You can find a great explaination of the -it flags at this StackOverflow answer\n\n\nImportant Note!\n\n\nIn a moment, we will use Jekyll to build the structure and theme for our site.\nBy mapping our site’s local git repository to /srv/jekyll in the container, we allow Jekyll to save all the site files it generates locally in our repo. These files are all GitHub needs to build our site at https://username.github.io.\nThis allows us to ditch our Docker container (and even the image) when we’re finished, freeing up the space taken up by Jekyll and its dependencies and leaving behind the site files for us to push to GitHub for hosting."

So now it’s time to choose your own!\nThere are a lot to choose from, and the Jekyll documenatation has a good list of resources for themes. I ended up at jekyllthemes.org and found Monophase. Not much more exciting than the Jekyll default we just saw, but I was going for minimal.\nMaybe Neumorphism is more your style?\nOr Windows 95?\n\n\nInstallation\n\nNote: It probably goes without saying, but always be aware of the licensing associated with others’ code you plan to download and use. Most free Jekyll themes only require attribution and already have it built into the footer of the theme.\n\n\nIt also absolutely goes without saying, but remember McGruff the Crime Dog says “always be mindful of any code you download from anywhere”. This is (obviously) not a security blog!\n\nIf you navigate to their GitHub repos, many of the themes at the links above have their own instructions for installation but for themes that don’t, it’s as easy as forking and pulling the repo and tweaking as needed.\n# First, fork the repo (see the link above)\n# Then clone locally\ngit clone https://github.com/username/windows-95\nThemes will have pages such as index, about, archive, etc… that can be edited to your liking.\nWe’ll leave further tweaking of style and layout as an exercise to the reader (because, to be honest, it’s an exercise for me also). Your theme of choice’s GitHub is usually a good place to start. There’s also google."

When I reached this point and was working through this problem initially, I felt I had made a mistake not going deeper on the API before beginning the game engine.

The above JSON response is very data-rich, but it’s also very specific to OGS. This Smart Game Format seems like something a bit more platform agnostic, so I think it makes sense to build against that as input.\nA quick search rendered some SGF Documentation; using this as a reference, we’ll grab the SGF file for our game. I’ve chosen an ongoing game with only a few moves, again for the sake of brevity:\nimport os\nimport requests\n\nBASE_URL = \"https://online-go.com/api/v1/games\"\ngame_id = \"68984609\"\nrequest_url = os.path.join(BASE_URL, game_id, 'sgf')\n\nr = requests.get(request_url)\n\nprint(r)\nprint(r.url, '\\n')\nprint(r.content.decode('utf-8'))\n&lt;Response [200]&gt;\nhttps://online-go.com/api/v1/games/68984609/sgf\n\n(;FF[4]\nCA[UTF-8]\nGM[1]\nDT[2024-10-26]\nPC[OGS: https://online-go.com/game/68984609]\nGN[Friendly Match]\nPB[8675threeohnine]\nPW[n_sweep]\nBR[25k]\nWR[18k]\nTM[604800]OT[7x604800 byo-yomi]\nRE[?]\nSZ[13]\nKM[6.5]\nRU[Japanese]\nC[Game chats will be available in SGF downloads once the game has finished.\n]\n;B[if]\n(;W[eh]\n(;B[hj]\n(;W[gd]\n(;B[df]\n(;W[dd]\n))))))\nA few observations:\n\nthe nested parentheses are an interesting choice\nmoves appear to come at the end, separated by semicolons\nbefore the moves comes metadata about the game\neach piece of data is preceded by a 1- or 2-letter code\n\nFirst, let’s parse this out into a more workable data structure. I want a dictionary for all of the metadata, and then a list of moves. With the re library, we can extract all the metadata with regular expressions and then the list of moves are a simple split:\nimport re\n\nsgf = r.content.decode('utf-8')\ntext = sgf.strip(')').split(';')\nmeta = dict(re.findall(r'(\\w+)\\[(.*?)\\]\\n?', text[1]))\nmoves = [tuple(m.strip('\\n()]').split('[')) for m in text[2:]]\n\nprint(meta)\nprint(moves)\n# metadata\n{'FF': '4',\n 'CA': 'UTF-8',\n 'GM': '1',\n 'DT': '2024-10-26',\n 'PC': 'OGS: https://online-go.com/game/68984609',\n 'GN': 'Friendly Match',\n 'PB': '8675threeohnine',\n 'PW': 'n_sweep',\n 'BR': '25k',\n 'WR': '18k',\n 'TM': '604800',\n 'OT': '7x604800 byo-yomi',\n 'RE': '?',\n 'SZ': '13',\n 'KM': '6.5',\n 'RU': 'Japanese'}\n\n# moves\n[('B', 'if'), ('W', 'eh'), ('B', 'hj'), ('W', 'gd'), ('B', 'df'), ('W', 'dd')]\n\nA Quick Tangent\nI want my program to have a human-readable index for these codes. A bit of searching around the aforementioned SGF documentation page yielded a property index consisting of some fixed width text including an ID field (letter codes) and a Description field for each code. Let’s scrape it!\nThis is a webpage rather than an API, which means this response will contain HTML data rather than JSON or plain text. With the help of Beautiful Soup, two quick lines parse the fixed width table into a list of strings:\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs\n\nr = requests.get('https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/proplist_ff.html')\nsoup = bs(r.content, 'html.parser')\nlines = soup.find('pre').text.strip().split('\\n')\n\nprint('Total lines:', len(lines), '\\n')\nprint(lines[:10])  # show the first ten lines\nTotal lines: 91\n\n['ID   FF   Description     property type    property value',\n '--  ----  --------------  ---------------  ---------------------------------',\n 'AB  1234  Add Black       setup            list of stone',\n 'AE  1234  Add Empty       setup            list of point',\n 'AN  --34  Annotation      game-info        simpletext',\n 'AP  ---4  Application     root             composed simpletext : simpletext',\n 'AR  ---4  Arrow           -                list of composed point : point',\n 'AS  ---4  Who adds stones - (LOA)          simpletext',\n 'AW  1234  Add White       setup            list of stone',\n 'B   1234  Black           move             move']\nI want to remove that second line that just has dashes, but it actually contains some useful information: the maximum number of characters present in each column…\nOr does it?\nWhile writing this section, I noticed that the 8th line in the above output, Who adds stones, goes one letter beyond the dashes in its header. Revisiting the page I’m scraping, there is even an instance where a description goes beyond the start of the next column, making this much less feasible to parse automatically.\n\nI did not really end up requiring this in the project (yet), so I’ll collapse the unused code below for the curious and move on from the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnused SGF Scraping Code\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom itertools import accumulate\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs\n\ndef sgf_data() -&gt; dict:\n    r = requests.get('https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/proplist_ff.html')\n    soup = bs(r.content, 'html.parser')\n    lines = soup.find('pre').text.strip().split('\\n')  # pyright: ignore\n    field_lengths = [len(d) for d in lines.pop(1).split(' ') if d]\n\n    coords = list(zip(\n        accumulate(field_lengths, lambda a, v: a + v + 2, initial=0),\n        field_lengths\n    ))\n\n    processed_lines = list(map(lambda ln: [ln[x:x+l].strip() for x, l in coords], lines))\n    keys = [field.lower().replace(' ', '_') for field in processed_lines.pop(0)]\n\n    return {ln[0]: dict(zip(keys[1:], ln[1:])) for ln in processed_lines}"
