Well, some people at Hasbro, probably. But\nsomeone else too: me. Not because I knew (or know) anything, but because I\nloved (love) that damn game.\n\nIt's September of 99, Magic is 6, Pokemon is nearly 3, and I am 11. And despite\nbeing smack in the bull's eye of Pokemon's target demographic, I'm already an\navid Magic player, thanks in no small part to my older cousin who found and\nplayed the game long before I was old enough to (I have fond memories of\nlooking at the wonderful artwork on his cards years before rediscovering the\ngame in middle school). Hasbro made the purchase and I was too young to really\n*get it*, but some of the older guys at the local card shop where I sourced my\nhabit lamented the end of an era.
